Not sure how to reach out to you 123venom but it seems the venom add on is having issues with watched status. It will not check it off as watched even if I manually select Mark as watched or watched in venom. It's not for everything but it it doesnt function most of the time. Example. The flash season 2 welcome to earth 2 and escape from earth 2 dont work no matter which way. Neither do the episodes after that. Do you know a fix?
